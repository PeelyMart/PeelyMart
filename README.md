### 🗃️ QuickServePOS — SQL Database Project
**2025 · Second Year · First Term**

A database-driven **Point of Sale (POS)** system developed for my **Information Management** course. The project focused on modeling and managing front-end restaurant operations such as table tracking, order recording, payments, and reporting using relational databases and SQL.

This project built on my earlier exposure to **MVC-style structuring** and strengthened my understanding of **project coordination** as the team size increased from two to four members. Development took place within an intensive **one-month timeframe**, similar to a short hackathon-style environment.

While I stepped back slightly from direct UI implementation compared to previous projects, I remained actively involved in **user experience (UX) planning**, particularly in defining system flows and interactions rather than visual interface design.

One of my key contributions was the **Session Tracker and Audit Log**, which records login and logout activity and associates system actions with authenticated sessions. This reinforced my growing interest in **backend and system-level features** that support accountability, security, and traceability.
